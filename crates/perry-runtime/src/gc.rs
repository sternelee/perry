//! Mark-sweep garbage collector for Perry
//!
//! Design:
//! - 8-byte GcHeader prepended to every heap allocation (invisible to callers)
//! - Arena objects (arrays/objects): discovered by walking arena blocks linearly (zero per-alloc tracking cost)
//! - Malloc objects (strings/closures/promises/bigints/errors): tracked in MALLOC_STATE
//! - Mark phase: conservative stack scan + explicit thread-local root scanning + type-specific tracing
//! - Sweep phase: free malloc objects; arena objects added to free list for reuse
//! - Trigger: only checked on new arena block allocation or explicit gc() call

//
// Each compiled function gets a *shadow-stack frame* that holds the
// currently-live heap-pointer-typed locals. Codegen emits:
//   - push at function entry with a precomputed slot count
//   - slot stores at each safepoint (allocation + runtime-call sites)
//   - pop at every return path
//
// The shadow stack is built but not yet consumed by GC in this phase.
// Phase B+ will teach the GC tracer to walk it as a precise-root source
// in parallel with the existing conservative scanner.
//
// Layout: the shadow stack is a contiguous `Vec<u64>` (per-thread).
// Each frame is:
//   [u64 prev_frame_top, u64 slot_count, u64 slot_0, u64 slot_1, ...]
// `SHADOW_STACK_FRAME_TOP` points at the current frame's slot_0 so
// slot stores are a single indexed write. `prev_frame_top` is the
// saved top from before this frame was pushed — so pop is a single
// load + store.
//
// Slots hold NaN-boxed `JSValue` bits (u64) — same format codegen
// already uses for pointer-typed locals. The GC tracer in Phase B+
// will call `try_mark_value` on each non-zero slot, matching the
// closure-capture tracer's pattern.

    //   - live → set `block_has_live[block_idx]` and clear the mark
    //     bit inline so we don't need a separate pass.

    //     retain other objects on the next GC cycle).

    // We deliberately do NOT push dead objects onto the global
    // ARENA_FREE_LIST. The inline bump allocator never reads the
    // free list — it uses the per-block reset instead. Pushing
    // dead objects to the free list would cost ~50ns per object
    // × ~700k objects per GC × ~12 GC cycles per benchmark = 420ms
    // of pure waste in `object_create`. The function-call allocator
    // path (`js_object_alloc_class_inline_keys` → `arena_alloc_gc`)
    // is the only consumer of the free list, and it's only used
    // for shapes the inline path doesn't cover (anonymous classes,
    // closure body new'd from a slot, etc.) — those are rare enough
    // that running them through the slow path is fine.
    //
    // After the walk, `arena_reset_empty_blocks` resets every block
    // with zero live objects to offset=0. This is the load-bearing

// The write barrier fires on every heap store. Semantics:
//   if parent is OLD and child points to YOUNG, add parent to

// Sub-phase C1 (this commit): runtime infrastructure — barrier
// function + remembered set storage + unit tests. No codegen
// emission yet (sub-phase C2). No minor GC consuming the set
// yet (sub-phase C3).
//
// Bounded false-positive policy: the remembered set is a HashSet
// of GcHeader pointers (NOT card-marks). False positives are
// safe (extra scan during minor GC, no correctness impact); false
// negatives would skip a live young-gen object and break
// correctness. The current implementation uses HashSet<usize>
// because pointer-tagged f64 NaN-boxing means the same heap
// pointer can appear via different tag bytes; storing the
// canonicalized GcHeader address dedups across tag variants.
